# Continuous Onboarding

I had this idea in 2014 at IBM Watson during a time when we were hiring often.
We found problems with our onboarding process every time someone started,
which was approximately monthly for some teams and quarterly for others.
People also switched teams with some frequency, generally permanently but sometimes temporarily _on loan_.

Note that I've never had management sufficiently interested in the benefits that this proposal offers to endure its
**very glaringly obvious risks**
including the work necessary to develop the software to manage the experience to prevent it from being
_catastrophic_
instead of an exercise in emergency preparedness and radical inclusiveness.

Take the advice with tremendous caution.
Consider the quality attributes of this proposal before ever considering it seriously.

â€¦And if you ever do, come find me.
You're my kind of crazy.
