### Title

Data Engineering the Code & Supply Compensation Survey Report

### Description

Code & Supply invested in building a data analysis and document authorship pipeline to produce its latest Compensation Survey Report.
Building on its experience in previous iterations, C&S used Python, Jupyter notebooks, pandas, Polars, Plotly, pandoc, and many other tools to analyze responses from more than 800 people and produce a more than 100-page report.
In this presentation, we'll will discuss the survey and analysis effort, which can serve as an example of how to get started doing data science, building consistent data visualizations, and collaborating on a large scientific paper.
We swear this isn't a Polars hype talk, but you'll leave wanting to use it.
