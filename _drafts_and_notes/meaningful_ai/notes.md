### Existential Risks - Dana Fried

> Just a reminder that the "existential risk" from AI is not
> that somehow we'll make Skynet or the computers from The Matrix.
>
> Nobody is going to give a large language model the nuclear codes.
>
> The existential risk is to marginalized people who will be silently refused jobs or health care or parole,
> or who will be targeted by law enforcement or military action because of an ML model's inherent bias,
> and that because these models are black boxes, it will be nearly impossible for victims to appeal.
>
> The existential risk is that the incredible repository of nearly all human knowledge
> that is the internet will be flooded with so much LLM-generated dreck that locating reliable information
> will become effectively impossible (alongside scientific journals,
> which are also suffering incredibly under the weight of ML spam).
>
> The existential risk is that nobody will be able to trust a photo or video of anything
> because the vast majority of media will be fabricated.
>
> The existential risk posed by AI is that we as a species will no longer be able
> to transmit and build on generational knowledge,
> which is the primary thing that has allowed human society to advance since the end of the last ice age.
