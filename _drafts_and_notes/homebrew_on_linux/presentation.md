## Previous FOSDEM presentations

**2021**: A documentation workflow loved by engineers and data scientists alike

**2024**: make python devex: _How a 45+ year old tool can MAKE Python developer experience easier_

**2024**: NixOS + $60 laptop = cellular router: _Building an LTE router with a $60 (new!) laptop and a single file_

::: notes

This is my presentation to FOSDEM, but my first in person and my fifth time attending FOSDEM in some way.

COLIN:

Please save your questions until the end.
We have a lot to cover and I need to keep pace to include all of it.
Please do shout out if you can't see something, though, or another technical
problem with the presentation occurs.

You can generally find me hanging out at the Homebrew table in the exhibition hall.
I've been a Homebrew contributor for 12 years and will complete my second term as one of its elected
Project Leadership Committee members in February 2027.

::: notes

I'm a huge fan of addressing problems through a problem-diagnosis-remedy
approach consistent with medical and other scientific approaches to problem
solving. If you search for "Colin Dean Problem Diagnosis Remedy" on the web,
you'll find my writings on it.

At a high-level, I'll be talking about a rather simple problem and diagnosis,
with a remedyâ€¦ that remedy is why you're here!

## Desktop Linux {.nocaptions}

![Debian Linux](debian.svg){height=3em}
![ElementaryOS](elementary.svg){height=3em}

:::

::: notes

Some packages in major distribution repos can fall behind
for a variety of reasons.
When I want the latest, I might be able to use backports
or switch to the testing release channel, but those might create other
conflicts that could disrupt my usage of the system.

Homebrew gives me what I want _now_, with less chance of a conflict.
It also only affects my user on the system, so other packages I install with
the distro package manager aren't affected unless they respect my user-level
PATH.

## Managed Linux

### ChromeOS {.nocaptions}

::: image-borders

![ChromeOS](chromeos.svg){height=3em}

:::

::: notes

I've used Homebrew on my Chromebook since 2020,
when I got an Intel-based Chromebook for the first time.
I'm a long-time Chromebook user, starting in 2016
with an ASUS Chromebook Flip when ChromeOS didn't have an official "Linux mode"
that really just runs Linux in a VM or container.

Why?
Just like the reasons for using it on desktop Linux, because inside "Linux mode,"
it's just another Debian or Ubuntu system.

:::

---

![Chromebrew](deps/chromebrew/chromebrew-logo.png)

<small><em>* unaffiliated with Homebrew</em></small>

::: notes

Chromebrew exists and is not a project of the Homebrew team.
Its name and package definition DSL are similar, but it's not a fork.
ChromeOS 117 effectively killed the Chromebrew installer, but the project
remains active and loved by those who prefer not to use "Linux mode,"
the VM of which has some performance implications and requires some system
administration, for updates and whatnot.

:::

---

### SteamOS {.nocaptions}

::: image-borders

![SteamOS](powered_by_steamos.svg){height=3em}

:::

::: notes

SteamOS, running generally on a Steam Deck game console,
is just Linux under the hood.
It's a customized version of Arch Linux.
You can use Homebrew on it!
Arch is another rolling package manager, but Valve, the company behind Steam,
puts the breaks on it a little for qualification and owns the system partition.
With Homebrew, you can use your Steam Deck in "desktop mode,"
which exposes the Linux as a desktop and enables using the Steam Desk as just
another computer.

(If presenting from the Steam Deck, point that out.)

# Takeaways

---

# What's next?

::: list-wip

* Pre-compiled ARM Linux "bottles"
* Beyond glibc

:::

::: notes

Homebrew does not officially support ARM Linux as of February 2025,
but this is maturing and the organization may decide to commit to it in the
future.
Currently, Homebrew technically does _work_ on ARM Linux, but requires building
all packages from source.
What's not yet in place is the infrastructure and volunteers to keep up with
any oddities of building more than 90% of our packages on ARM Linux.

Then there's also some exploration of supporting C standard libraries beyond
glibc, such as musl.
That's in the far future.
