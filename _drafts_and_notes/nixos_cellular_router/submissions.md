> Because I used nixOS on a really crappy laptop to build an LTE router

## Talk title

Building an LTE router with a $60 (new!) laptop and a single file

## Abstract for your talk

I took an unused $60 LTE-enabled laptop bought in a fire sale during the pandemic
and an LTE SIM card
and with zero experience with NixOS, built a router for my newly purchased home
so I could have the minimal Internet necessary for its security system and home automation
without having to record what I did in case the laptop died.

I did this in a few hours with less than 100 lines of Nix.
I did not think that it would be this easy.

This talk will cover some hijinks of NixOS,
using LTE for home internet somewhere you don't yet live,
and the joy of things that Just Work... when they work.
