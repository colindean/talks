> Because I used nixOS on a really crappy laptop to build an LTE router

## !!Con 2024

## Talk title

Building an LTE router with a $60 (new!) laptop and a single file

## Abstract for your talk

Having bought a new house but not intending to move in until completing extensive renovations,
I needed Internet for some home security systems.
I don't have an LTE modem and didn't want to wait for one to ship or sign up for some expensive plan in a cellular store.
Needing it nearly immediately and wanting to spend as little as possible,
I grabbed an LTE SIM off the shelf at a retail store
when I remembered I had an unused $60 LTE-enabled laptop bought in a fire sale during the pandemic.
Expecting this laptop not to last, I wanted a durable configuration that I could save and never think about again.
I decided to explore the promise of NixOS.
I was up and running in a few hours.
This talk will cover some hijinks of NixOS,
using LTE for home internet somewhere you don't yet live,
and the joy of things that Just Work... when they work.
