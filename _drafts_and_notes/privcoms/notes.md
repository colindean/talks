## If nothing else, remember these

* Decide on your **threat model**
* Think about how your contacts are stored and discoverable
* Think about weak points: other people; use forward secrecy

TL;DR In 2025, use Signal.

## Forward secrecy

It really means _backward_, previous comms, are secure from future communication errors, and vice versa.

Key expiration is important.

Some threat actors are able to store encrypted messages for decryption when the technology exists.

## Legal Threats from Nation-State Actors

## TODO

* Don't use encrypted email, it's become an anti-pattern.
