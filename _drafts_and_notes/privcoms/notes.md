## If nothing else, remember these

* Decide on your **threat model**
* Think about how your contacts are stored and discoverable
* Think about weak points: other people; use forward secrecy

TL;DR In 2025, use Signal.

## "Nothing to hide? Nothing to fear"

> … a logical fallacy which states that individuals have no reason to fear or oppose surveillance programs
> unless they are afraid it will uncover their own illicit activities.
> An individual using this argument may claim that an average person
> should not worry about government surveillance, as they would have "nothing to hide".

## Forward secrecy

It really means _backward_, previous comms, are secure from future communication errors, and vice versa.

Key expiration is important.

Some threat actors are able to store encrypted messages for decryption when the technology exists.

## Threats from third parties and (AI) assistant technology

### Sharing may not be caring

> by conjoining all of these separate services [and] muddying their data
