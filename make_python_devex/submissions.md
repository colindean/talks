### Title

`make python devex`: Towards Clone to Red-Green-Refactor in One Command with a 45+-Year-Old Tool

(Submitted as "`make python deps check test build`: Towards Clone to Red-Green-Refactor in One Command" but changed in production)

### Description

Getting productive with a Python codebase, especially when you're unfamiliar with the ecosystem, can be daunting. Building a cohesive strategy with widely-available tooling shortens the time-to-productivity for new contributors to projects internal and open-source, demonstrating that the maintainers care about onboarding and the developer experience. I'll give an introduction to how my team solved this problem using a 46-year-old program and push the audience in a direction toward better developer experiences starting at the greatest common denominator of tooling.

### Notes

This talk will be a condensation of a ~25 minute talk I gave internally that covers how we set up Make and Homebrew to configure a Python development environment with pyenv and poetry. I'll omit much of the in-depth coverage of Make and probably focus on the intent and outcomes more than the actual tech used.

### Talk Objective

By the end of the 10 minutes, the most important takeaway will be the idea that all projects should have a Makefile with five tasks: deps, check, test, build, and help.

### Title

make python deps check test build: Towards clone to red-green-refactor in one command

### Description

Getting productive with a Python codebase, especially when you're unfamiliar with the ecosystem, can be daunting. Building a cohesive strategy with widely-available tooling shortens the time-to-productivity for new contributors to projects internal and open-source, demonstrating that the maintains care about onboarding and the developer experience. Learn how my team goes from zero to test-driven development of our Python codebases in (nearly) one command.

### Notes

In this talk, I'll review the basics of the venerable make ecosystem and some supporting cast members useful for automating development environment setup on a per-project basis. We'll install some tools that install Python and set up tooling that makes IDEs and CLIs happy, too. Some concepts are modeled after niceties found in other modern language ecosystems and build tools. We've deployed this system on more than a half-dozen codebases at the time of talk submission and will likely exceed two dozen before April 2022.

This presentation is aimed at folks who want to make it easier to onboard new contributors to their Python codebases by exploring environment setup automation approaching the much-sought "one command" gold standard by embracing the idea that every project should have a Makefile that has deps, check, test, and build commands regardless of the underlying ecosystem and should "just work" after installing dependencies with make deps.

Some familiarity with Make would accelerate learning, but I'm anticipating covering enough of it that folks who haven't seen it before should be OK. This will be most valuable for folks who have experienced the pain of not really knowing the Python ecosystem and how to set up the common tools, esp. when coming from an ecosystem where there is "the one tool" that does everything.

TSWBAT construct a basic Makefile, add customization to install Python(s), run checks and tests, and build an artifact.

### Abstract

Getting productive with a Python codebase, especially when you're unfamiliar with the ecosystem, can be daunting. Building a cohesive strategy with widely-available tooling shortens the time-to-productivity for new contributors to projects internal and open-source, demonstrating that the maintains care about onboarding and the developer experience. Learn how my team goes from zero to test-driven development of our Python codebases in (nearly) one command.

### Description

In this talk, I'll review the basics of the venerable `make` ecosystem and some supporting cast members useful for automating development environment setup on a per-project basis. We'll install some tools that install Python and set up tooling that makes IDEs and CLIs happy, too. Some concepts are modeled after niceties found in other modern language ecosystems and build tools. We've deployed this system on more than a half-dozen codebases at the time of talk submission and will likely exceed two dozen before April 2022.

### Audience

This presentation is aimed at folks who want to make it easier to onboard new contributors to their Python codebases by exploring environment setup automation approaching the much-sought "one command" gold standard by embracing the idea that every project should have a Makefile that has `deps`, `check`, `test`, and `build` commands regardless of the underlying ecosystem and should "just work" after installing dependencies with `make deps`.

Some familiarity with Make would accelerate learning, but I'm anticipating covering enough of it that folks who haven't seen it before should be OK. This will be most valuable for folks who have experienced the pain of not really knowing the Python ecosystem and how to set up the common tools, esp. when coming from an ecosystem where there is "the one tool" that does everything.
